Kattis Problem Development
==========================

Development of Kattis exercises for activities at ITU.

The problem format is compatible with the [Kattis problem tools](https://github.com/Kattis/problemtools).

Algorithm Design

* Interval Scheduling (intervalscheduling).

TODO: Remove some of the slow AC solution to make the problem harder. 
* Weighted Interval Scheduling (weightedintervalscheduling).

Will Code for Drinks
--------------------

### Fall 2019

* **A** – Ask Marilyn (`askmarilyn`). Works. Needs more submissions, hard to debug. Needs Kattis expert attention.
* **B** – Bar Shelf (`barshelf`). Done. Very good shape. 
* **C** – Cheaper Drink (`cheaperdrink`). Works. Needs more AC submissions.
* **D** – Drinking Song (`drinkingsong`). Works. Probably ready. More submissions would be good.
* **E** – Elder Scroll Bar (`elderscrollbar`). Works Needs more data files, maybe better explnatation of where the thumb goes. Image missing.
* **F** – Thank God it’s Friday (`tgif`). Works. Probably ready. Needs more submissions. Needs better image.

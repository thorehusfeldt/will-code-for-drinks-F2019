==========================

Development of Kattis exercises for activities at ITU.

The problem format is compatible with the [Kattis problem tools](https://github.com/Kattis/problemtools).

Will Code for Drinks
--------------------

### Fall 2019

* Ask Marilyn (askmarilyn). Works. Needs more submissions, hard to debug. Needs Kattis expert attention.
* Bar Shelf (barshelf). Works. Probably ready, needs some more submissions.
* Cheaper Drink (cheaperdrink). Works. Probably ready, needs more submissions.
* Drinking Song (drinkingsong). Works. Probably ready. More submissions would be good.
* Elder Scroll Bar (elderscrollbar). Not ready. Needs more data files, and better explnatation of where the thumb goes. Image missing, description too long.
* Thank God it’s Friday (tgif). Works. Probably ready. Needs more submissions. Needs better image.

Friday is the highlight of Børge and Åse’s life.
They can meet up with their buddies in the ITU Friday bar and discuss anything they want: the weather, sports, favourite editors, politics, religion, and gossip about celebrities.
Life can be good.

Unfortunately, they don’t know which day of the week it is!
They’ve woken up in a strange apartment, phones missing, and with little memory of the recent past.
Which day is it? Which \emph{year} is it even?

After some searching, they establish today’s date, because the calendar on the wall displays it.
Also, Åse has found the remains of an old newspaper from 1 January in her handbag, which has that weekday printed on the front page.

Help Børge and Åse figure out if today is Friday.

\section*{Input}

On the first line, today’s date.
The date consists of two parts, separated by space.
The first part is in an integer (the day of the month) $d$, with $1\leq d\leq 31$.
The second part is the name of the month, abbreviated as \texttt{JAN}, \texttt{FEB}, \texttt{MAR}, \texttt{APR},
\texttt{MAY}, \texttt{JUN}, \texttt{JUL}, \texttt{AUG}, \texttt{SEP}, \texttt{OCT}, \texttt{NOV}, or \texttt{DEC}.

On the second line, the name of the day on 1 January of the current year, abbreviated as \texttt{MON}, \texttt{TUE}, \texttt{WED}, \texttt{THU}, \texttt{FRI}, \texttt{SAT}, \texttt{SUN}.


\section*{Output}

Output a single line:
The four letters \texttt{TGIF}, abbreviating ``Thank God it's Friday'' if today is certainly Friday.
The two words \texttt{not sure} if today might be Friday, depening on if this year has a 29th of February.
The emoticon \texttt{:(} if today is certainly not Friday.

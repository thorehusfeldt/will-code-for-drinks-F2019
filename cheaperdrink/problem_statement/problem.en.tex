Instead of worrying about the current hyperinflation you decide to go down to the local bar and have a drink.

The prices at the bar are displayed using magnetic signs with numbers printed on them, with each magnet showing one more more digits.
For instance, the price of 1106 adjusted megacredits is displayed like this:

While the bartender is busy serving the next customer, you have just enough time to rearrange the price of your favourite beverage to make it as cheap as possible.
But be quick about it!

Invidual magnets can be moved around in any order, or turned upside-down.
The numbers are shown in a script that makes it difficult for the bartender to distinguish 0, 1, and 8 from their upside-down counterpart.
Moreover, 6 and 9 look the same when one is turned upside-down.
The example price above could be turned into 116, almost ten times cheaper, by turning the first magnet:

You have to use all the magnets, otherwise the bartender will immediately suspect foul play.

\section*{Input}

On the first line, the number $n$ of magnets, with $1\leq n\leq 100\,000$.
On the next $n$ lines, exactly one sequence $m_i$ of digits describing the number printed on the $i$th magnet.
Sequence $m_i$ for $i\in \{1,\ldots, n\}$ consists of at least one and at most 100 digits from $0$, $1$, $\ldots$, $9$.
The price currently displayed on the bar is the integer described by the concatenation $m_1\cdots m_n$ of the magnets in the order they are given, from left to right.
Note that a magnet can be all $0$s, except for $m_1$ (because it wouldn't make sense for the bar to display the price with a leading magnet of only $0$s).

\section*{Output}

A single line containing a sequence of digits, representing the smallest number than can be written using the magnets $m_1,\ldots,m_n$, rearranged in any order, and each of them possibly turned upside-down.

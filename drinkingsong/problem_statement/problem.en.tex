\emph{Ninety-Nine Bottles of Beer} is an anonymous folk song dating to the mid-20th century.
It is a traditional reverse counting song, sometimes used to sing on long trips, as it has a very repetitive format which is easy to memorize and can take a long time to sing.
The lyrics describe a quantity of bottles that is reduced by $1$ in every verse, until no bottles are left, at which point the song ends somewhat abruptly.

Many variations and similar songs are known in other languages.

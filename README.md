Will Code for Drinks Fall 2019
==============================

* **A** – Ask Marilyn (`askmarilyn`). Works. Needs more submissions, hard to debug. Needs Kattis expert attention.
* **B** – Bar Shelf (`barshelf`). Done. Very good shape. Consider making it scoring (so that the quadratic solution still gets some positive feedback.)
* **C** – Cheaper Drink (`cheaperdrink`). Works. Needs more AC submissions.
* **D** – Drinking Song (`drinkingsong`). Works. Probably ready. More submissions would be good.
* **E** – Elder Scroll Bar (`elderscrollbar`). Works. Needs more data files, maybe better explnatation of where the thumb goes. Image missing. Maybe remove requirement for correct placement of thumb? Maybe make scoring?
* **F** – Thank God it’s Friday (`tgif`). Works. Probably ready. Needs more submissions. Needs better image.

Will Code for Drinks Fall 2019
==============================

* **A** – Ask Marilyn (`askmarilyn`). Works. Needs more submissions, hard to debug. Needs Kattis expert attention.
* **B** – Bar Shelf (`barshelf`). DONE. Not great.
* **C** – Cheaper Drink (`cheaperdrink`). DONE.
* **D** – Drinking Song (`drinkingsong`). DONE.
* **E** – Elder Scroll Bar (`elderscrollbar`). DONE. 
* **F** – Thank God it’s Friday (`tgif`). DONE. Maybe find better image.

Will Code for Drinks Fall 2019
==============================

* **A** – Ask Marilyn (`askmarilyn`). BROKEN. Needs more submissions, hard to debug. Needs Kattis expert attention.
* **B** – Bar Shelf (`barshelf`). DONE. Not great.
* **C** – Cheaper Drink (`cheaperdrink`). DONE.
* **D** – Drinking Song (`drinkingsong`). DONE.
* **E** – Elder Scroll Bar (`elderscrollbar`). Works. Needs more data files, maybe better explnatation of where the thumb goes. Maybe remove requirement for correct placement of thumb?
* **F** – Thank God it’s Friday (`tgif`). DONE. Needs better image.
